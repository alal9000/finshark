FE: vercel
BE: aws lightsail + docker
DB: aws RDBS












=======================================================
prompt:

so my plan to deploy my finshark app would be 3 sperate deployments for fe, be and db.

front end: use vercel to deploy the TS + react

back-end: use my aws lightsail instance + containers to deploy the .NET web api via docker

db: use aws RBDS to serve the db

would this work?
